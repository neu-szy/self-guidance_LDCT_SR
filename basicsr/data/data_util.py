def paired_paths_from_lmdb(folders, keys):
    """Generate paired paths from lmdb files.

    Contents of lmdb. Taking the `lq.lmdb` for example, the file structure is:

    ::

        lq.lmdb
        ├── data.mdb
        ├── lock.mdb
        ├── meta_info.txt

    The data.mdb and lock.mdb are standard lmdb files and you can refer to
    https://lmdb.readthedocs.io/en/release/ for more details.

    The meta_info.txt is a specified txt file to record the meta information
    of our datasets. It will be automatically created when preparing
    datasets by our provided dataset tools.
    Each line in the txt file records
    1)image name (with extension),
    2)image shape,
    3)compression level, separated by a white space.
    Example: `baboon.png (120,125,3) 1`

    We use the image name without extension as the lmdb key.
    Note that we use the same key for the corresponding lq and gt images.

    Args:
        folders (list[str]): A list of folder path. The order of list should
            be [input_folder, gt_folder].
        keys (list[str]): A list of keys identifying folders. The order should
            be in consistent with folders, e.g., ['lq', 'gt'].
            Note that this key is different from lmdb keys.

    Returns:
        list[str]: Returned path list.
